- ### Hotel Table
  The Hotel must have a name and ID and a location and a phone number all of them are primary keys since they must be unique for each location.

The relation between the Hotel and the Hotel Room is One-Many since one hotel can have many hotel rooms.

- ### Hotel Room
  The Hotel Room must have an ID and a number and they are foreign and composite keys since they depend on the location of the hotel and on the type of the Room.

It should also have the hotel ID as a foreign key.

The relation between the hotel room and the room is Many-One since the hotel room can consist of Many rooms

- ### Room
  The Room has an ID and a Name and a Type and all of them are primary keys since each room is unique.

The relation between the Room and Room Amenities is One-Many since many room amenities can be in one room

- ### Room Amenities

The Room Amenities has the Amenities ID as Foreign key as it is unique and a Room ID as a composite key between the Room and the Amenities

The relation between the Room Amenities and the Amenities is Many-One since many amenities can be in a room amenity

- ### Amenities

The Amenities has and ID and Name as a primary key because each one must be unique than the other

For today, Lab14 was done and we did tha navigation properties of the project and the routing

we added the capability of adding and deleting an amenity to and from a room in the room controller

POST: api/Rooms/{roomId}/{amenityId}

DELETE: api/Rooms/{roomId}/{amenityId}

We also added the ability to add a room to a hotel or delete a room from a hotel

DELETE: api/HotelRooms/{hotelId}/Rooms/{roomNumber}

PUT: api/HotelRooms/{hotelId}/Rooms/{roomNumber}

Lab16 was done and the DTOs were implemented in the project so they can change the output of the controllers so now it can show additional details about the hotel and the rooms in itwith the amineties in each room

### DTO Implementations

    public class HotelDTO
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string StreetAddress { get; set; }
        public string City { get; set; }
        public string State { get; set; }
        public string Phone { get; set; }
        public List<HotelRoomDTO> Rooms { get; set; }
    }


    public class HotelRoomDTO
    {
        public int HotelID { get; set; }
        public int RoomNumber { get; set; }
        public decimal Rate { get; set; }
        public bool PetFriendly { get; set; }
        public int RoomID { get; set; }
        public RoomDTO Room { get; set; }
    }

    public class RoomDTO
    {
        public int ID { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Layout { get; set; }
        public List<AmenityDTO> Amenities { get; set; }
    }

    public class AmenityDTO
    {
